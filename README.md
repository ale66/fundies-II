Welcome to the GH repo for the DSTA module.

The repo mirrors what is normally available from Download on Moodle or on the [satellite site](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ale/dsta/).

It contains all materials (lectures, codes, notebooks) seen in class.
Feel free to fork it to create your own class notes.

Remember: classes start on Week 2 of the term and the folders maintain the numbering of the week in which they are presented.
